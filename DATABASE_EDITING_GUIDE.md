```

**Multiple Images:**
```json
[
  "https://images.pexels.com/photos/123456/car1.jpg",
  "https://images.pexels.com/photos/123457/car2.jpg",
  "https://images.pexels.com/photos/123458/car3.jpg"
]
```

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
- Click on images cell
- Paste the JSON array
- Press Enter
- ✅ Images update instantly!
